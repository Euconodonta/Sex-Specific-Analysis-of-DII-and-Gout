# Data and Analysis Code for "Diet-induced inflammation and gout prevalence" Study

This repository contains the dataset (`datav4.csv`) and R scripts used for the analyses in the manuscript titled "Diet-induced inflammation and gout prevalence: Sex-specific findings from a cross-sectional analysis in the representative US population" (Manuscript ID: AJCN-D-25-01128).

## Dataset: `datav4.csv`

* **Source:** The data was derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
* **Processing:** The raw NHANES data underwent a cleaning and preparation process using the `shuffle.R` script included in this repository, resulting in the `datav4.csv` file.
* **Content:** This CSV file contains the analytical dataset used for the study.
    * **IMPORTANT:** A detailed description of each column (variable) in `datav4.csv`, its meaning, units, and any relevant codes should be provided here or in a separate data dictionary file (e.g., `data_dictionary.md` or `data_dictionary.csv`). **[请您在此处补充每一列的具体含义，或者创建一个单独的数据字典文件并在此处说明。例如：]**
        * `variable1`: Description of variable 1 (e.g., Age in years).
        * `variable2`: Description of variable 2 (e.g., Sex, 1=Male, 2=Female).
        * ... (and so on for all columns)

## R Scripts

This repository includes three R scripts which should generally be run in the following order:

1.  **`shuffle.R`**:
    * **Function:** This script is responsible for data cleaning, preprocessing, and a_gout_study_data_codeMing of the initial NHANES data to generate the final analytical dataset (`datav4.csv`).
2.  **`calculate.R`**:
    * **Function:** This script performs the main statistical calculations and generates most of the tables presented in the manuscript.
    * **Dependency:** This script uses the `datav4.csv` file generated by `shuffle.R`.
3.  **`plot.R`**:
    * **Function:** This script is used to generate the figures and plots included in the study.
    * **Dependency:** This script likely uses data objects created by `calculate.R` or the `datav4.csv` file directly.

## System Requirements

* **R Version:** The scripts were developed and tested using `R version 4.4.1`.

## Required R Packages

The following R packages need to be installed to run the scripts:

* `dplyr`
* `tidyr`
* `ggplot2`
* `VIM`

You can install these packages in R using the following command:
```R
install.packages(c("dplyr", "tidyr", "ggplot2", "VIM"))
```

## Dataset: `datav4.csv`

* **Source:** The data was derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
* **Processing:** The raw NHANES data underwent a cleaning and preparation process using the `shuffle.R` script included in this repository, resulting in the `datav4.csv` file.

## R Scripts

This repository includes three R scripts which should generally be run in the following order:

1.  **`shuffle.R`**:
    * **Function:** This script is responsible for data cleaning, preprocessing, and a_gout_study_data_codeMing of the initial NHANES data to generate the final analytical dataset (`datav4.csv`).
2.  **`calculate.R`**:
    * **Function:** This script performs the main statistical calculations and generates most of the tables presented in the manuscript.
    * **Dependency:** This script uses the `datav4.csv` file generated by `shuffle.R`.
3.  **`plot.R`**:
    * **Function:** This script is used to generate the figures and plots included in the study.
    * **Dependency:** This script likely uses data objects created by `calculate.R` or the `datav4.csv` file directly.

## System Requirements

* **R Version:** The scripts were developed and tested using `R version 4.4.1`.

## Required R Packages

The following R packages need to be installed to run the scripts:

* `dplyr`
* `tidyr`
* `ggplot2`
* `VIM`

You can install these packages in R using the following command:
```R
install.packages(c("dplyr", "tidyr", "ggplot2", "VIM"))
```
